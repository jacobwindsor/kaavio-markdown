# Kaavio Showdown
A Showdown extension for enabling the use of Kaavio's manipulation API within 
[MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The aim of this library is to allow easy creation of interactive
descriptions to accompany Kaavio diagrams.

**Note**: Kaavio is under development. It is now only used to render diagrams in [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org).
Kaavio is currently being developed as [Pvjs](https://github.com/wikipathways/pvjs/) (the WikiPathways Kaavio wrapper) 
but it will be extracted into it's own generic library soon.

## Getting started
### For writers
If you're not a developer and are just looking for how to write interactive descriptions, then go to the guide [here](writers).

### For developers
For how-tos on extending and integrating Kaavio Showdown then go to [the developers page](developers).
